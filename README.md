- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Silva. I live in The Netherlands near Amsterdam.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently following a traineeship towards becoming a Software Engineer. While my initial 2 month training was in Java, in my current position I program in C#.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about a load of different topics related to Development and operation of webapps and API's.
I'm passionate about Apple, so I'm interested in Swift as well. That said I want to focus on one topic at a time.
